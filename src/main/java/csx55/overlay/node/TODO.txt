Messaging node is a total mess right now. We can register and take in CLI prompts which is awesome! But currently the IP is hardcoded for connecting to the registry so that has to change. Furthermore all we can do is accept RegisterResponse events, so build more event functionality of course. Add some logic for nodes to send wires to other nodes as well, we worked hard on those wireformats so please use them. Right now the logic for registering needs to be reworked as well, it depends on a connectTo method that's half done and has an awkward return - better to handle all the random crap in-method so it's encapsulated. After cleaning it up into a final draft at least for milestone 1???? maybe 2, submit it once and see how you do, fix based on feedback of course. only move on once 4/10 reached since that is assignment minimum in order to drop a lowest grade.
